# Bioinformatics Laboratory - [Laboratory Name]

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Bioinformatics Laboratory [Laboratory Name] at the University of [University Name].

## About Us

We are a research group dedicated to the application of computational methods for the analysis of biological data. Our areas of interest include:

* Gene expression data analysis (RNA-seq, microarray)
* Mutation data analysis (WES, WGS)
* Clinical data analysis
* Development of bioinformatics tools
* Biological data visualization

## Objectives

* Develop and apply cutting-edge bioinformatics methods for biological research.
* Share our tools and results with the scientific community.
* Promote research reproducibility.
* Train the next generation of bioinformaticians.

## Main Research Areas

Our laboratory focuses on the study of **cancer stem cells (CSCs)** and their role in cancer progression, with particular attention to **colon cancer** and **thyroid cancer**. We use **xenotransplantation** models to study stem cell transformation and metastasis.

Our research includes:

* **CSCs biology:** study of the molecular mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and differentiation of CSCs.
* **Cancer metastasis:** identification of cell populations responsible for metastasis and development of strategies to prevent it.
* **Tissue stem cell oncogenesis:** study of the transformation of normal stem cells into CSCs.
* **Development of new targeted therapies:** identification of new molecular targets and development of targeted therapies for CSCs and signaling pathways involved in metastasis.

Our goal is to translate our discoveries into new therapies to improve the survival of cancer patients.

## Main Projects

This repository contains a collection of tools, scripts and projects developed by our laboratory.

* **Oncogene-driven thyroid cells transformation: normal versus cancer stem cells:** Identification of genetic changes that occur in thyroid stem cells leading to their transformation into CSCs. - [Link to specific README]
* **Cancer Stem Cells: new molecular targets involved in colon cancer metastasis:** Study of the molecular mechanisms that regulate colon cancer metastasis and identification of new therapeutic targets. - [Link to specific README]
